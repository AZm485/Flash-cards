This is a study program I created to help me study algorithms and also practice integrating an SQLite database into a Python project

I originally thought of this project when I was struggling with deciding if I should study algorithms or practice coding more. That is when I decided to do both. This project allowed me to study while also practicing coding in Python. This is also the first time I created my own database and implemented it into my code. 

With this project, I do plan on adding more tables and rows in other tables as well. I also may come back to my program and create classes.
